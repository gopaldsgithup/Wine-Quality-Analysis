# Wine-Quality-Analysis

Description

This repository contains an analysis of a wine quality dataset, which includes physicochemical properties of wine samples and their corresponding quality ratings. The dataset comprises 6,497 samples of red and white wines, with features such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol levels, along with a quality rating and color classification.

Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis has the following features:

fixed_acidity: Measured acidity level.

volatile_acidity: Volatile acidity content.

citric_acid: Citric acid content.

residual_sugar: Residual sugar content.

chlorides: Chloride level.

free_sulfur_dioxide: Free sulfur dioxide content.

total_sulfur_dioxide: Total sulfur dioxide content.

density: Density of the wine.

pH: pH level.

sulphates: Sulphate content.

alcohol: Alcohol percentage.

quality: Quality rating (e.g., 1 to 10).

color: Type of wine (e.g., red or white).

Objectives

The primary goals of this project include:

Data Cleaning: Handle any inconsistencies or missing values in the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the relationships between wine properties and quality.

Feature Engineering: Prepare the dataset for machine learning tasks.

Model Building: Develop and evaluate predictive models to classify wine quality.

Key Insights

Wines with higher alcohol content and balanced acidity generally receive higher quality ratings.

Red and white wines have distinct physicochemical properties that influence their quality differently.
